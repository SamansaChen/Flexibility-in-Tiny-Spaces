# HOME-Flexibiliy in Tiny Spaces -- Introduction


## Definition of home:
- Portable
- Have a self-sufficient system
- Can fit in small areas
- Wood structure/material
- Make people feel convenient and comfortable

A home to me is not only a place to live, but also something that has emotional 
connections with people. A fancy and expensive hotel can be a good place to take a 
vacation, but it can never be a place for permanent living. Home can not be defined by 
its size or location, the organization of the interior spaces and decoration are the things 
that can make it become a home. It needs to make people feel comfortable, warm and 
feel free to do what they want. It is hard to give “home” a specific definition, but, for 
me, the core of home is the ability that make people want to live in this place.

## Define a client: 
Young office workers in big cities/ single with a pet or a couple with a pet

## Site Analysis:
This project is meant to be portable, so that abandoned railway tracks will be a good site for this project.
